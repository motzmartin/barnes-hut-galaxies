"The Barnesâ€“Hut simulation (named after Josh Barnes and Piet Hut) is an approximation algorithm for performing an n-body simulation. It is notable for having order O(n log n) compared to a direct-sum algorithm which would be O(n2). The simulation volume is usually divided up into cubic cells via an octree (in a three-dimensional space), so that only particles from nearby cells need to be treated individually, and particles in distant cells can be treated as a single large particle centered at the cell's center of mass (or as a low-order multipole expansion). This can dramatically reduce the number of particle pair interactions that must be computed."
